        <p>
          Indeed, I was born into this world with a limited time. <br/>But I always wonder why it has to be in a place of infinity?{" "}<br/>
          <em>
            Where the time time has no beginning and end?<br/>
            Where the universe is so vast that cannot be fathom by human minds?<br/>
            Where the people are unsure if multidimentional universe is true?<br/>
            Where counting of numbers is limitless?<br/><br/>
          </em>
          <strong>But overthink no more</strong><br/><br/>
          <em>
            I am just a finite being. Not a perfect human with limited time.<br/>
            Embrace life and have fun enduring the hardships. Do whatever I want. To continue learning and to always quit when bored. Enjoy life to the fullest! and to always remind myself to put my feet on the ground for I am just a finite being.
